# Global_GPP_VPM_NCEP_C3C4
GPP VPM v2.0
simulation of global GPP using the NCEP reanalysis II considering C3 and C4 difference

## submodules
the code can be devided into several categories: 
(1) process the climate data; 
(2) process C3/C4 landcover data; 
(3) calculate LSWImax; 
(4) gap-fill and smooth EVI;
(5) generate GPP product.
